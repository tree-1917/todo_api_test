# **Dependency Injection (DI) in Python**

> **Introduction**

In software development, dependency injection (DI) is a design pattern that facilitates decoupling code components and promotes loose coupling. It achieves this by providing dependencies (objects, services, or resources) to a function or class through injection rather than having the code create or find them itself. This approach leads to several advantages:

- **Improved Testability:** DI allows you to easily inject mock objects during testing, isolating the component under test and making tests more reliable.
- **Enhanced Maintainability:** Code is cleaner and easier to understand by separating concerns and reducing reliance on complex object hierarchies.
- **Increased Flexibility:** Different implementations of dependencies can be used without modifying the core logic, making the code more adaptable.

> **Common Approaches to DI in Python**

Several techniques can be employed for dependency injection in Python. Here are the most common ones:

1. **Constructor Injection:** Dependencies are passed as arguments to the constructor of a class.

   ```python
   class TaskService:
       def __init__(self, task_repository):
           self.task_repository = task_repository

       def create_task(self, title, description):
           # Use the injected task_repository to create a task
           ...
   ```

2. **Setter Injection:** Dependencies are injected using setter methods within a class.

   ```python
   class TaskService:
       def __init__(self):
           self._task_repository = None

       @property
       def task_repository(self):
           return self._task_repository

       @task_repository.setter
       def task_repository(self, value):
           self._task_repository = value

       def create_task(self, title, description):
           # Use the injected task_repository to create a task
           ...
   ```

3. **Service Locator:** A central registry holds references to dependencies, and code retrieves them through a locator object. This approach is less common in modern Python due to its potential for tight coupling.

   ```python
   class ServiceLocator:
       _services = {}

       def register(self, name, service):
           self._services[name] = service

       def get(self, name):
           return self._services.get(name)

   class TaskService:
       def __init__(self):
           self.task_repository = ServiceLocator().get("task_repository")

       def create_task(self, title, description):
           # Use the injected task_repository to create a task
           ...
   ```

4. **Dependency Injection Frameworks:** Frameworks like `DependencyInjector` or `FastAPI` provide built-in mechanisms for managing dependencies and simplifying DI implementation.

> **Tutorial: Dependency Injection for a FastAPI Application**

This tutorial demonstrates using `DependencyInjector` to implement DI in a FastAPI application:

1. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install dependency-injector fastapi
   ```

2. **Define Dependencies:**

   - Create a file named `containers.py` to define dependencies:

     ```python
     from dependency_injector.containers import DeclarativeContainer
     from dependency_injector.providers import Factory

     class Container(DeclarativeContainer):
         # Define dependencies here (e.g., database connection)

         task_repository = Factory("path.to.TaskRepository")  # Replace with your implementation
     ```

3. **Implement Application Logic:**

   - Create a file named `app.py` to define the FastAPI application with dependency injection:

     ```python
     from fastapi import FastAPI
     from dependency_injector.ext import extensions
     from .containers import Container

     app = FastAPI()
     container = Container()

     app.dependency_injector = extensions.DependencyInjector(
         app=app, containers=[container]
     )

     @app.get("/")
     async def get_all_tasks(task_service: container.task_service):
         # Use the injected task_service to retrieve tasks
         return await task_service.get_all_tasks()
     ```

   - Remember to replace `"path.to.TaskRepository"` with the actual path to your task repository implementation.

4. **Run the Application:**

   ```bash
   uvicorn app:app --reload
   ```

> **Explanation:**

- `DeclarativeContainer` from `dependency_injector` is used to define the container for your application's dependencies.
- `Factory` provider allows you to specify the dependency creation logic (e.g., instantiating a database connection or a service class).
- FastAPI's `
